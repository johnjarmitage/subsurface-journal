> A new open-access journal for peer-reviewed research in Digital Earth and Planetary Sciences

Initial guidelines, ideas, suggestions, and more for a journal **from the community for the community.**

Jump right into the [issues](https://github.com/softwareunderground/subsurface-journal/issues) to add your ideas about how a journal should look like. We would like to hear about scope, feature, accessibility, peer review process, technology, licensing, possible journals in kind, sources of funding, and anything our ideas do not cover yet. You can open new issues and add to existing ones.

**You do not need prior experience in running a journal or coding. We will figure it out together.**

Please also check out the #journal channel on the [Software Underground Slack](http://softwareunderground.org/slack). As per usual discussion here and in the community falls under our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/softwareunderground/code-of-conduct).

Why another journal?
